#BRAIN TUMUOR DETECTION TNSDC
Brain tumor detection is a crucial area of medical diagnosis and imaging analysis aimed at identifying abnormal growths within the brain. Such growths can be benign or malignant and may require immediate medical intervention. Here's an explanation of how a brain tumor detection project might work:

Brain tumor detection projects involve collecting brain image datasets, preprocessing images, extracting relevant features, and training machine learning models (e.g., CNNs) to classify images as tumor or non-tumor. These models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy and sensitivity. Successful models are deployed in clinical settings to aid radiologists in accurate diagnosis. Continual improvement is achieved through data collection, refining techniques, and model updates. The process aims to enhance brain tumor diagnosis efficiency, ultimately improving patient care and outcomes.
